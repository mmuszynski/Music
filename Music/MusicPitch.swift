In Western music, there are generally assumed to be twelve discrete, named semitones which comprise an interval span called an octave.

///In many cases, a pitch can be described by more than one name. In this case, these pitches are considered 'enharmonically equivalent' (although their frequencies will be different, for more, see `frequency(with referencePitch: at frequency:)`).
