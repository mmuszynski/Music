/// An `Error` describing the various reasons that a `MusicInterval` could not be created
///
/// - InvalidQualityQuantityCombination: The `MusicIntervalQuality` is invalid or does not match the `MusicIntervalQuantity` (e.g. Perfect Third)
/// - InvalidNaturalLangaugeString: The `String` used to initialize the interval was invalid
/// - CouldNotComputeDestniationPitch: The destination pitch could not be computed. Usually this means that the destination pitch would require an exotic modifier such as a triple flat.
/// - undefined: Any error that does not fit into the above. This is slated to be removed in a future release.
